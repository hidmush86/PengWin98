# PengWin98 - KDE Plasma6 Nostalgic System Sound Pack
Decided to make a sound pack that would match my Win98 KDE theme. It's a mix of Win98/Win95, Kid Pix, & AIM sounds.


## Instructions
1. In a terminal:
```bash
mkdir ~/.local/share/sounds # should this directory not exist
cd ~/.local/share/sounds
git clone https://github.com/hidmush86/PengWin98.git
```
2. Search for `System Sounds`
3. Select `PengWin98`

That's it! Not all the sounds have been replaced, and sounds that have not will be the default `Ocean` sound pack. Feel free to fork or recommend additional sounds. Enjoy!
